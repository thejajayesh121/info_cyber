# INTERNET OF THINGS
## IoT Architecture Overview

### Layers:
- Perception (Sensors, Actuators
- Network (Routers, Gateways, Protocols)
- Application (Smart Home, Healthcare, Industrial IoT)
- Communication Protocols: MOTT, COAP,ZigBee,BLE

### Common IoT Vulnerabilities
- Default or hardcoded credentials (e.g., admin: admin)
- Unencrypted communication
- Weak authentication mechanisms
- Insecure firmware updates
- Lack of device patching
- Exposure of IoT endpoints to the internet (shodan indexing)

  ## IoT Attacks (Case Studies)
- Mirai Botnet (2016): DDoS attack using vulnerable IoT devices
- Ring Doorbell Data Leak: Unencrypted video feed
- Smart Car Hacks: Remote control vulnerabilities in connected vehicles

# IoT Security Frameworks & Standards
- Open Worldwide Application Security Projec (OWASP) IoT Top 10
- IoTSecurity Foundation (IoTSF) Compliance Framework
- NISTIR NISTIR8259 - Device Cybersecurity Capabilities
- ENISA Guidelines for IoT risk management

## IoT Security Measures
  - Network segmentation for IoT devices
  - Strong password & certificate-based authentication
  - secure firmware OTA updates
  - Logging & monitoring of device behaviour
