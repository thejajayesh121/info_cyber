# Artificial intelligence(AI) in cybersecurity
## Core Concepts

## Role of AI/ML in Cybersecurity
- Machine learning for intrusion detection and malware analysis
- Predictive analytics for attacks prevention
- AI-driven SOC automation (SOAR tools)

### AI Techniques in security
- supervised learning:Malware classification (Benign vs Malicious)
- Unsupervised learning learning:Anomaly detection in logs
- Reinforcement learning: Adaptive response systems

### Application of AI in threat detection
- Email phising detection using NLP
- Behavior-based edpoint protection
- Network traffic anomaly detection(IDS?IPS enhancement)
- User and Entity Behavior Analytics(UEBA)

### AI-Powered Tools&Platforms
- IBM QRadar Advisor with watson
- Darktrace (AI for network anomaly detection)
- Crowdstrike falcon (AI endpoint protection)
- CylancePROTECT , Azure sentinel (ML-based alerts)

### Limitations & Ethical challanges
- Adversarial ML (poisoning data,evasion attacks)
- Privacy concerns (training data exposure)
- Explainability issues (AI decision transparancy)
